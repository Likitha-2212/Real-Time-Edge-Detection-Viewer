# EdgeApp (Android + JNI + C++ OpenCV-like processing + OpenGL ES)
This is a scaffold project produced by ChatGPT (full project skeleton). It includes:
- Android app (Kotlin) with Camera2 preview
- JNI bridge to native C++ code
- C++ processing module (edge detection placeholder)
- OpenGL ES renderer + simple shaders
- CMakeLists and Gradle files
- A minimal TypeScript web viewer (static)
Files are scaffolded and **not** fully dependent on OpenCV installation; native code uses placeholder processing to simplify building.
