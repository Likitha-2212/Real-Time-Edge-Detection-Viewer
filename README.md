# EdgeApp (Android + JNI + C++ OpenCV-like processing + OpenGL ES)
This project provides a tidy and minimalistic scaffolding for an end-to-end imaging pipeline, including: 

android app (Kotlin) with Camera2 live preview, 

JNI bridge from app to native C++, 

processing module in C++ with easy placeholder edge detection method, 

OpenGL ES renderer with minimal shader code to visualize frames, 

CMake and Gradle project configs, and 

lightweight TypeScript web-based viewer to view/display or simmulate processed output. 

This is meant to be a solid foundation for running camera or image processing applications.
