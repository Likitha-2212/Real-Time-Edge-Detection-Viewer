# EdgeApp (Android + JNI + C++ OpenCV-like processing + OpenGL ES)
This project provides a tidy and minimalistic scaffolding for an end-to-end imaging pipeline -

Including: 

Android app (Kotlin) with Camera2 live preview. 

JNI bridge from app to native C++. 

Processing module in C++ with easy placeholder edge detection method.

OpenGL ES renderer with minimal shader code to visualize frames. 

CMake and Gradle project configs. 

Lightweight TypeScript web-based viewer to view/display or simmulate processed output. 

This is meant to be a solid foundation for running camera or image processing applications.
